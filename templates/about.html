    <p>The origins of ice cream, sorbet and other chilled dairy treats are difficult to pin downâ€”but span back to antiquity.
         According to popular legend, ice cream was invented by the ancient Chinese,
         brought to Italy by Marco Polo, to France by Catherine de Medici, and thence to America by Thomas Jefferson.17 Apr 2023</p>
